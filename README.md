# ArcadeGame
## About

This game is based on the classic arcade game Frogger and is created as a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Instructions

Clone or Download the repository to your local computer. Open the *index.html* file in your favorite browser. Enjoy! 

The game begins on load of the page.

The goal is to make it across the pavement to the water. The player should use the arrow keys to navigate the character across. 

Avoiding the bugs as the player makes it across is crucial. If the character collides with a bug, a GAME OVER! modal will display. The player can then click the repeat symbol to reset the game and try again, or they can select the X in the right hand corner to exit the modal back to the original screen. 


If the character makes it all the way across, a GREAT RUN! modal will display. The player can then click the repeat symbol to reset the game and try again, or they can select the X in the right hand corner to exit the modal back to the original screen.   

When either modal displays, the animation ceases in the background. Clicking the repeat symbol effectively reloads the page.
